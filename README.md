**Overview**

**Situation**
Treat actors can easily change a file or infrastructure to evade detection, making threat hunting harder. 
CTI provides the adversary insights while integrated data sources supply the evidence. 
CTI provides the who, why, and how, while the integrated provides the what, the observable evidence inside your environment.
