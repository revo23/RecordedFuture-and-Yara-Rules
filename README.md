**Overview**

**Situation**
Treat actors can easily change a file or infrastructure to evade detection, making threat hunting harder. There are various threat hunting techniques such as using hypothesis-driven threat hunting, CTI integration, AI/ML, graph-based threat hunting and adversary emulation.
In this example we look into more effective threat hunting depends by fusing threat intelligence with customized YARA/Sigma rules. CTI provides the adversary insights while integrated data sources in the SIEM supply the evidence.


**Task**
Scale threat hunting through automation from CTI platforms such as RecordedFuture. Eliminate hours of manual rule-writing with Auto YARA and Sigma rules.

**Steps**

1. Access RecordedFuture > Threat > Malware Intelligence
